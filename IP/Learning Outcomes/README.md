Below you can see my first yaml file that uses sonarcloud too check the quality of my code.

 Left picture: in the left picture you can see the yaml file. By default on every push it builds and test the service. When pushing to master branch it will build test and deploy the service to my dockerhub online.
 
 Right picture: in the right picture you can see the result of my yaml file. As seen in the picture it succesfully builds, tests and deploys the service.
